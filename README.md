# Machine Learning for ASCVD Prediction
This repository contains code to train, validate, and test machine learning models for predicting Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease using variables captured from the Electronic Health REcord (EHR). 

# Details
The main hyperparameter tuning is in `medical_ML.py`. 

The imputation tuning is done in the various main files (e.g. `main_allvars_missing.py`)

The oversampling tuning is done in `main_oversampling.py`.
